# 🧠 Real-Time Face Detection with OpenCV

This project showcases a simple yet powerful real-time face detection system built using OpenCV and Python. It uses a webcam to capture live video, converts each frame to grayscale, detects faces using a pre-trained Haar Cascade model, and highlights detected faces with bounding rectangles.

## 📸 Features

- Real-time webcam capture
- Grayscale frame conversion
- Face detection using Haar Cascade (`detectMultiScale`)
- Draws bounding boxes around detected faces
- Press `'q'` to exit the video feed safely

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
